# introduction to Linux Assignment1

# in this assignment, I am going to explain what I am doing, why I am doing them and what I have learned through this Practical Assignment.



 # I am going to creat the structure of the work before answering the questions.

 mkdir -p Linuxclass/practice:I use this command to creat Linuxclass as parent directory and practice as child directory.
 ls : to see if the Linuxclass directory is there, yes it is there.

 cd Linuxclass: I use this command to go in parent directory Linuxclass.
 ls : to check if practice is in parent directory as a child directory.

 cd practice: changing directory from Linuxclass to practice.
 mkdir else,command and P1: to create else,command and P1 in Practice subdirectory.

 touch command: I used this to create a file Info in command subdirectory.
 ls: to check if it is there.

 cd -: one move backward from Command to Practice subdiectory.
 cd P1:change directory to P1 to be able to work in it.
 mkdir Hi P2: create Hi and P2 subdirectory in P1 subdirectory.

 cd Hi :go to Hi directory to be able to work in it. 
 touch Hello: create a file called Hello in Hi subdirectory.
 mkdir P3: create P3 subdirectory.

 cd P3: here I am going in P3 subdirectory.(cd P3) 
 mkdir Here: create Here subdirectory.
 touch hereWeAre: create a file hereWeAre.   

am done to create the structure, what I get from this activity is that you can't create a subdirectory in a file, file has to be conntaining data or information.

using a Relative Path to write a command that takes me in my ho

# Answering the Questions Practically.

1. i # using a relative path to write a command that takes me in my home Directory.
cd or cd ~
ii. # using a absolute path to write a command that takes me in my home Directory.
cd/home/ 

2. i. # using a relative path to write a command that shows a long listing of Here.
ls -l

ii. # using absolute path to write a command that shows a long listing of Here.
ls -l /workspaces/Introduction_to_linux/Linuxclass/P1/Hi/P3/here/

3. # copy of the file P3 to command directory.

 i # if I am in P2 directory by using relative path.
    cp -r ../Hi/P3  ../command

ii. #  if I am in P3 directory by using relative path.
cp -r ../P3/. ../command

iii. # if I am in command directory by using relative path.
 cp -r ..P1/Hi/P3 ../command

iv. # use an absolute path.
cp -r /workspaces/Introduction_to_linux/Linuxclass/practice/P1/Hi/P3/ ../command/


4. # copy the files in P3 to the command directory.

 i. # if I am in P2 directory by using relative path.
 cp ../Hi/P3/*/* ../command 

ii.#  if I am in P3 directory by using relative path.
cp ../P3/./*/* ../command

iii.# if I am in command directory by using relative path.
 cp ../P1/Hi/P3/*/* ../command

iv.#  use an absolute path.
cp  /workspaces/Introduction_to_linux/Linuxclass/practice/P1/Hi/P3/*/* ../command/



   5. The difference between the two questions is that on Q3 I made a copy of the P3 directory with all its subdirectory and file but on Q4 I only made a copy of P3 its subdirectory and its file, I din't copy P3 directory. 


   6. Yellow typically indicates a file. In this case, info and Hello are files.

  Blue typically indicates a directory. home, tmp, Linuxclass, Practice, Else, Command, P1, P2, P3, and Here are all directories.

  hereWeAre is  yellow. The reason is that it's shown as the end of a path and is at the bottom of the tree, which usually signifies a file.
